### v0.15.2
- Fixed dehacked infinite ammo

### v0.15.1
- Fixed split times being off by 1
- Fixed analysis stats not resetting when hitting the demo restart key (e.g., pacifist tracking)
- Added "track demo attempts" option. When enabled, displays "Attempt x / y" at the start of a demo, where x is the count for the current session (increases when you use the demo restart feature) and y is the total count (based on the demo filename). Defaults to on
  - File names now follow this pattern, so the attempt count matches the filename: file.lmp, file-00002.lmp, file-00003.lmp (skip -0 and -1)
- Added many cheat bindings - you can now activate idclip, iddqd, iddt, etc at the touch of a button
- Protected more things with strict mode:
  - show alive monsters
  - health bars
  - palettes
  - iddt, idbehold, idmypos

### v0.15.0
- Fixed a desync in saves / key frames related to a bug in mbf thinker subclasses
- Fixed a desync in saves / key frames related to the msecnode graph
- Fixed a bug where the initial wipe could eat frames
- New option: "wipe at full speed" - causes the wipe animation to always run at 100% game speed (defaults to on)
- New feature: use "-first_input f s t" to build the first tic for tases, where f = forwardmove, s = sidemove, and t = angleturn.
  - Example: "-first_input 50 50 32" will do a quarter turn left and sr50 forward right
