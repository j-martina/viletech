A few environment variables need to be set before invoking `nimble dbg` or `nimble rel`. The following is a list of those variables, along with the values I use as examples:

```bash
VTEC_LIB_DIRS='--clibdir:/usr/local/lib --clibdir:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu'
VTEC_WASMTIME_DIR='/home/jerome/Data/wasmtime'
```
