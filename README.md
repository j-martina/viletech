# VileTech

## About

VileTech is a collection of Doom-related Rust technologies, oriented towards the building of new tools, game engines, and games descending from id Software's id Tech 1 engine.

The goals of the VileTech "project" are as follows, in descending order of priority:
1. [![justforfunnoreally.dev badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/justforfunnoreally-dev-9ff)](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)
2. Facilitate the development of a catch-all [language server](https://github.com/jerome-trc/doom-ls) for Doom content development.
3. Expose functionality developed in the Doom open-source ecosystem which is currently unavailable (i.e. due to being tied up in existing applications) as a public API, first with a Rust interface and then with a C API.
4. Build a new Doom source port as an alternative to [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org), with the orthogonal goals of:
	- Implementing improvements which are impractical for GZDoom due to technical debt.
	- Adding features which fall outside GZDoom's scope.
	- Eliminating compatibility for the 1% of legacy user content which GZDoom supports to its detriment.

Beware that this project:
- is deep in development. None of these crates are published for good reason; nothing is feature complete or rigorously-tested. You should not assume that an interface which isn't marked `unsafe` is safe.
- is strictly a solo hobby project. The code within this repository is going to be deeply disorganized for the foreseeable future.

## Contents

### /cli

[viletech-cli](/cli/README.md) - VileTools - is a command-line interface for a set of tools built on the other parts of VileTech for performing common operations related to Doom modification, like building binary-space partition data for levels.

### /client

[viletech-client](/client/README.md) is an application for running games and editing associated content; it is the primary way for end users to interact with the engine.

### /data

[viletech-data](/data/README.md) - VileData - is a library underpinning the engine which provides data representations and reader/writers, kept separate to provide functionality for any outside parties who need to interact with formats in the id Tech 1-descendant ecosystem.

### /doomfront

[doomfront](/doomfront/README.md) is a collection of parsers for Doom-related domain-specific languages.

### /engine

[viletech](/engine/README.md) is a crate for backing the client and the dedicated server by rolling up all the other constituent parts of this repository and adding features needed to run games, like physics simulation.

### /lith

[lithica](/lith/READMEm.md) is the bespoke scripting language that gets embedded into the VileTech Engine (although it is agnostic to the software it underpins).

### /mus2midi

[mus2midi](/mus2midi/README.md) is a small library containing only a Rust port of a DMXMUS-to-MIDI converter.

### /server

[viletech-server](/server/README.md) is a dedicated (a.k.a. "headless") game simulation runner with a CLI for serving other clients.

### /utils

[viletech-utils](/utils/README.md) is where small helper symbols which may not necessarily be related to Doom but are still useful to multiple other crates go.

### /vfs

[viletech-fs](/vfs/README.md) - VileTechFS - is a "virtual file system"; an abstraction over the user's "real" or "physical" operating system's FS to ease usage for the engine and mod developers, as well as providing a layer of "information hiding".

### /wadload

[wadload](/wadload/README.md) contains functionality for reading and writing files in the "Where's All the Data" (WAD) file format native to Doom.

### /zmsx

[ZMSX](/zmsx/README.md) (ZMuSic eXperiments) is a fork of the ZMusic library, accompanied by automatically-generated Rust FFI bindings and a safe Rust wrapper.
